## Overview

### The challenge

You are tasked to build a given design brief. Weâ€™re providing a full design in 3 different sizes, full desktop, tablet and mobile, and this is the first real project where you should take your time and make sure that it looks acceptable at any screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to work with breakpoints and media queries when making responsive websites. I also learned a little about SASS like how to mixins and variables.

### Continued development

I liked using SASS a lot. I want to see if I can incorporate it in future projects. I'm also interested in Tailwind so I may use that instead. Overall, I want to get better at responsive design and also designing websites from scratch.

### Useful resources
